## RA policy
### skeleton code

The following code is to calculate the parameter of the exponential model, lambda in case of RA according to Equation (C-1) on the page 114 in RP-1. 

$$ \lambda=  \frac{X}{I-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=0}^N  X_i I_i}, $$

where *X* is the total number of observed OOTs, $X_i$ and *I* is the sum of the observed resubmission times  $I_i$. $X_i$ is 1 if the *i*th calibration record is OOT or 0 otherwise. In this calculation, a regular recalibration period was assumed for simplicity.

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
